diff : it is a linux terminal command used to check the difference between two files. It's a lot faster than simply viewing to find the bugs or the difference.
version control systems : we can reflect back on our work or the history of our work at any point of time.
commit : checkpoint at certain intervals such that it has any, not huge changes. git commit also commits all files within the repository
git log : show all commit lists.
git log --stat : also shows status of changes.
git diff : same as diff for git.
git checkout : to check the previous versions of the file.
